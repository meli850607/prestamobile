2. FEATURES

- Easy to Install

Bitnami Stacks are built with one goal in mind: to make it as easy as
possible to install open source software. Our installers completely automate
the process of installing and configuring all of the software included in
each Stack, so you can have everything up and running in just a few clicks.

- Independent

Bitnami Stacks are completely self-contained, and therefore do not interfere
with any software already installed on your system. For example, you can
upgrade your system's MySQL or Apache without fear of 'breaking' your
Bitnami Stack.

- Integrated

By the time you click the 'finish' button on the installer, the whole stack
will be integrated, configured and ready to go. 

- Relocatable

Bitnami Stacks can be installed in any directory. This allows you to have
multiple instances of the same stack, without them interfering with each other.

  - PrestaShop 1.7.3.3

5. INSTALLATION

The Bitnami PrestaShop Stack is distributed as a binary executable installer.
It can be downloaded from:

https://bitnami.com/stacks/

The downloaded file will be named something similar to:

bitnami-prestashop-1.7.3.3-0-linux-installer.run on Linux or
bitnami-prestashop-1.7.3.3-0-linux-x64-installer.run on Linux 64 bit or
bitnami-prestashop-1.7.3.3-0-windows-installer.exe on Windows or
bitnami-prestashop-1.7.3.3-0-osx-x86-installer.dmg on OS X x86.

On Linux, you will need to give it executable permissions:

chmod 755 bitnami-prestashop-1.7.3.3-0-linux.run


To begin the installation process, double-click on that file, and you will
be greeted by the 'Welcome' screen. Pressing 'Next' will take you to the
Component Selection screen, where you can select the phpMyAdmin component. This
tool intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the web.

The next screen is the Installation Folder, where you can select where Bitnami 
stack will be installed. If the destination directory does not exist, it will 
be created as part of the installation. 

The next screen will prompt you for data necessary to create the initial
admin user: 

Username and password: You will use this information to log-in into the
administrative interface. The password you provide here will also be used to
protect other parts of the installation. Please see the section named
"Usernames and Passwords" later in this document.

Real name: The name that will be displayed in the application.

Email address: Your email address.

The next screen will vary, depending on whether the ports needed by the
bundled Apache and MySQL are already taken. The default listening port for
Apache is 8080 on Linux or port 80 on WIndows and for MySQL is 3006. If those 
ports are already in use by other applications, you will be prompted for 
alternate ports to use.

The next screen will allow you to configure the final details of your
PrestaShop installation:

Hostname: The hostname for your blog, such as www.example.com. This
information will be used by PrestaShop when creating certain links.

Once the information has been entered, the installation will proceed to copy
the files to the target installation directory and configure the different
components. One this process has  been completed, you will see the
'Installation Finished' page. You can choose to launch Bitnami PrestaShop Stack
at this point. If you do so, your default web browser will open and
display the Welcome page for the Bitnami PrestaShop Stack. 

If you received an error message during installation, please refer to
the Troubleshooting section.

The rest of this guide assumes that you installed Bitnami PrestaShop Stack
in /home/user/prestashop-1.7.3.3-0 on Linux or C:\Bitnami\Bitnami PrestaShop Stack
on Windows or /Applications/prestashop-1.7.3.3-0 on OS X and that you use port 8080 
for Apache on Linux or port 80 on Windows and 3306 for MySQL. 

6. STARTING AND STOPPING BITNAMI PRESTASHOP STACK

The Bitnami Application Manager is a simple graphical interface included in
the stacks that can start and stop the Bitnami servers. It is are located
in the same installation directory.

To start the utility, double click the file named ‘manager-linux’,
'manager-windows' or 'manager-osx' from your file browser.

Alternatively, you can also start and stop the services manually, as explained below.

To start/stop/restart application on Linux and OSX you can use the included ctlscript.sh
utility, as shown below:

       ./ctlscript.sh (start|stop|restart)
       ./ctlscript.sh (start|stop|restart) mysql
       ./ctlscript.sh (start|stop|restart) apache
       ./ctlscript.sh (start|stop|restart) varnish

  start      - start the service(s)
  stop       - stop  the service(s)
  restart    - restart or start the service(s)

On Windows, you can start and stop Bitnami PrestaShop Stack using the shortcuts created
in the Start Menu, under Programs -> Bitnami -> Bitnami Service

That will start Apache service. Once started, you can open your
browser and access the following URL on Linux or OS X:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/prestashop/

And you can access the following URL on Windows:

http://127.0.0.1/prestashop/

If you selected an alternate port during installation, for example 18080, the
URL will look like:

http://127.0.0.1:18080/prestashop/

The Administration section is at "/prestashop/administration".

If you are accessing the machine remotely, you will need to replace
127.0.0.1 with the appropriate IP address or hostname.

7. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

The installation process will create several subfolders under the main
installation directory:

	apache2/: Apache Web server.
        varnish/: Varnish(TM) Cache
	php/: PHP Scripting Language.
	mysql/: MySQL Database.
	apps/
	  prestashop/: PrestaShop application folder
	    conf/: PrestaShop Apache configuration files
	    htdocs/: PrestaShop PHP application files
	  phpMyAdmin/: phpMyAdmin application folder (optional)

8. DEFAULT USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS

The PrestaShop administrative user and password are the ones you set at
installation time. 

MySQL admin user is called 'root', and its password is the same as the
PrestaShop administrative user password.

The default MySQL non-root account used to access the database is named
bitnami, and its password is also bitnami. 

The phpMyAdmin administrative user is 'root'.

9.1 Installer

# Installer Payload Error 

If you get the following error while trying to run the installer from the
command line:

"Installer payload initialization failed. This is likely due to an
incomplete or corrupt downloaded file" 

The installer binary is not complete, likely because the file was
not downloaded correctly. You will need to download the file and
repeat the installation process. 

9.2 Apache

If you find any problem starting Apache, the first place you should check is
the Apache error log file:

/home/user/prestashop-1.7.3.3-0/apache2/logs/error.log on Linux or
C:\Bitnami\Bitnami PrestaShop Stack\apache2\logs\error.log on Windows or
/Applications/prestashop-1.7.3.3-0/apache2/logs/error.log.

Most errors are related to not being able to listen to the default port.
Make sure there are no other server programs listening at the same port
before trying to start Apache. Some programs, such as Skype, may also use
port 80. For issues not covered in this Quick Start guide, please refer to
the Apache documentation, which is located at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/  

9.3 MySQL

The following are some common problems: 

# Access denied when trying to connect to MySQL. 

If you get an Access Denied message while trying to connect to
MySQL, make sure you are using the correct username and password. 

# "Can't connect to server" message. 

Make sure that the MySQL daemon is up and running. Remember also that if
during installation you selected a different listening port for MySQL, you
may need to pass that as an extra command line option.

For help in troubleshooting MySQL errors, you may want to reference the
"Problems and Common Errors" section of the MySQL manual, which you will
find at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/
